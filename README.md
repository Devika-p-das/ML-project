## üîç Network Attack Classification - Machine Learning Project

## üìå Project Description
This project focuses on classifying network traffic based on attack types using supervised machine learning models. It includes data exploration, preprocessing,Feature Engineering, SMOTE for class balancing, and a modeling pipeline with performance comparison across several classification algorithms.

**üìÇ Project Structure**:
     * Data Loading
     * Data Exploration
     * Data Visualization
     * Data Cleaning
     * Data Splitting
     * Model Building
     * Model Evaluation


4.  **Model Used:** Trained and compared several machine learning models:
    * XGBoost Classifier
    * Logistic Regression
    * Decision Tree
    * Random Forest
    * Gradient Boosting
    * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
5.  **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the models using metrics such as:
    * Accuracy
    * Precision
    * Recall
    * F1-score
    * ROC AUC
    * Confusion Matrix
6.  **Model Saving:** The best-performing model was saved for potential future use.
